    <h2>Description </h2>
    <p>It's time to put that waffle iron languishing in the back of your cabinet to good use. These airy, delicate and crisp-edged waffles are so fabulous, yet so simple to throw together, they're destined to become part of your weekend breakfast routine. Freeze leftovers, if you have any, in Ziplock
         bags and serve them during the week. You can pop them in the toaster to reheat (use a light setting) and they come out nearly as well as freshly made, maybe even slightly crunchier.</p>
